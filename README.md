# Udacity-Tableau-Flight-Delays-project
This is one of data visualization projects in Data Science Nanodegree program at UDACITY. Base on the information which came from a Kaggle dataset, it tracked the on-time performance of US domestic flights operated by large air carriers in 2015. I created four visualizations in Tableau with my insight as the followings.
# Insight 1
• It showed that the worst arrival delay airport at US in 2015 was Hartsfield Jackson Atlanta International Airport (17,641 times arrival delay)

• DL airline has 11,402 arrival delay times at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta 
International Airport in 2015 as the 1st worst rank of the total number of 
arrival delay airlines at each airport in US.

• A map chart is used that provides a visualization of the geographic area of 
the United States, which contains data from the primary source data. 
Provides the ability to highlight subdivisions so that it is easier for the user 
to see the most delayed arrival

# Insight 2
• There are 14 airlines to carry out US domestic flights in 2015. Among of 
them, WN(Southwest) Airline has the worst records; 58,438 arrival delays 
and 59,437 flight cancellation from US domestic airports as No. 1 lowest 
performing domestic airline.

• A Bar Chart is used to show data with minimal chart junk. A general 
negative slope can be seen as a trend

# Insight 3
• There are 8 major causes for flight delays in this chart; Airline delay, Air 
System delay, Departure delay, Diverted, Late Aircraft delay, Security delay, 
and Whether delay. All 8 major causes’ counters tell us that the 6th day of 
week is the least flight delay day in the week.

• A line plot is used allow us to represent data in a simple way - with a wide 
range of numbers and data points

# Insight 3
• This visualization shows the occurrences of cancellations due to reasons 
Airline/Carrier, Weather , National Air System . It can be seen that the 
primary cause of cancellations is Weather which accounts for more than 
half.

• A pie chart is used to between a few categorical variable and Many 
numerical variable easy to show the results to the user

# Dashboard visualization
The below Dashboard visualization chart is about the insights of US domestic 
flights and airports operation related data sets. we are able to find out four major 
insights from this visualization dashboard regarding flights’ arrival delays at major 
US domestic airports & airlines with major causes.
